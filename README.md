Findings of Reddit Data

Hello there! 
I started working on Reddit data. It was a huge dataset and my computer crashed when I wanted to load the data into R.
Hence, I read one day of data (May 1st) and did the analysis on it. Eight different questions were investigated on the data and their final results in terms of plots are presented in the "issues" of this respority. The source code for the analysis is included in Rcode.R in this respority.

Question 1:
What are top ten subreddits in number of comments? (plot 1)

Question 2: 
What words appear the most in "nfl" subreddit comments? 
Top 50 words are shown in a world cloud. More frequent words have larger sizes.(plot 2)

Question 3:
What is the frequency of comments per hour?(plot 3)

Question 4:
What are top ten subbredits with high score comments? (plot 4)

Question 5:
What are number of authors for top ten subreddits? (plot 5)

Question 6: 
What are the percentages of comments that include links for top ten subreddits? (plot 6)
