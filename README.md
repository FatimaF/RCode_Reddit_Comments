Findings of Reddit Data

Hello there! 
I started working on Reddit data. It was a huge dataset and my computer crashed when I wanted to load the data into R.
Hence, I read one day of data (May 1st) and did the analysis on it. Eight different questions were investigated on the data and their final results in terms of plots are presented in the "issues" of this respority.
